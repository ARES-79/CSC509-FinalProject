# CSC509-FinalProject
Reading &amp; Emotion Tracker

#Project Overview
The project is a prototype for an application to help users read more efficiently. 
It uses mouse data to simulate eye tracking and an emotion-tracking headset (real or virtual)
to help users visualize emotion patterns while reading in real-time. The application
highlights text to signify the main emotion while reading that section and shows the 
frequency of each emotion.
